effects in collisions

short x, vx, ax;
short y, vy, ay;


bounces off sightly, but can push through object
ax = -ax;
ay = -ay;

or better yet (pushes through using current speed and keeps pushing
vx -= ax;
vy -= ay;


bounce
vx = -vx;
vy = -vy;
or 
vx = vx * -1;
vy = vy * -1;
or
vx = -vx + ax;
vy = -vy + ay;

curves
vx = vx - 50;
vy = vy - 50;

slows down
vx = vx >> 1;
vy = vy >> 1;
better yet (not such a huge slowdown)
vx += (ax + ax);
vy += (ay + ay);



bad
vx = x;
vy = y;

stops completely and will not move again
vx = -ax;
vy = -ay;
